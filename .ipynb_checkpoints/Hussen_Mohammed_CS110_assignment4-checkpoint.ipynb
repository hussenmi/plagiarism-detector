    "If we try to compare two submissions for plagiarized text, we can simply do it the brute force way and compare every substring. But that would take a lot of time and would be very inefficient. Here, using data structures and algorithms, we optimize the process. We use hash tables and hash functions to achieve this. By using hash function, we can convert the substring into an integer representation and then we can use the modulo operator to find the index of where that should be inserted into the list of buckets we have. But now, we can see a problem. If two substrings somehow end up with the same integer representation, then, they will also end up in the same index in our list. That is called a collision. Therefore, here we can see that there are two things that are important to take into account of. The first is the hash function itself. The ideal hash function needs to have the following properties:\n",
    "1. Repeatable: if we have the same input, it should give us the same result every time we run the function\n",
    "2. Fast: it should be fast to compute\n",
    "3. Output unsigned integer: it should not output a negative integer\n",
    "4. Random distribution: it should randomly distribute the keys among the output space. We can have an unlimited number of inputs but our output space is limited. If we are using unsigned integers, we can have from 0 to 2^32-1 and it should be randomly distributed among these numbers\n",
    "5. Small differences in the input should have large differences in output: for example, the hash value for 'dog' and 'dogs' should give us completely different results that are not very close to each other. This will be helpful in making sure that they don't get accidentally mixed up\n",
    "\n",
    "The other parameter that we need to keep track of is the value of q, the value we mod our hash value by to get the index in our hash table. To begin with, it is preferred for it to be a prime number. That is because, if it's not a prime number, when we use it to mod other numbers, we can have the same remainders for a lot of numbers and that causes a collision. If we use a prime number, though, we can decrease the rate of collision because when we mod using a prime number, the chance that different numbers will have the same remainder is small as compared with non-prime numbers. Now, the question becomes which prime number should we choose? Even though there is no right answer for this, in my implementation, I set this value equal to the smallest prime number just above the table size. So I need to clarify how I choose the table size. For my two strings, x and y, if I need to create a hash table for x, then I set the table size equal to the smallest prime number that is greater than 1.2 times the number of characters in x. Therefore, if x has a length of 5, I would multiply 5 by 1.2 and find the smallest prime number that is greater than 1.2 * 5. I chose 1.2 because I want the table size to be a bit bigger and thus have a bit more space for the substrings. This way, the table won't be completely full and there won't be overflowing. If the table size is too small, it is easy for the table to fill up and overflow unless we dynamically adjust it after a certain portion of the table is full. This is what happens in the Python dictionary as well. It starts by allocating 8 slots and then when the table starts to become full, then it creates another table and then copies all of the stuff over to the new table. This happens when the load factor is about 2/3. As we can see here, there is a trade-off being made. If we want the constant time we are promised using hash tables we should make the size of our hash table very big but if we want to save space and only add additional memory when we need it, then that means we have to copy over the whole table every time and takes time (which is slower than constant time). But this is not the only way to deal with collisions. We can also deal with them using chaining. In this method, every bucket in the list is a linked list and thus, if we have similar indexes that need to be fulfilled in the same spot, we just add them to the linked list. There are certain assumptions we need to make here as well. In order to add them to the linked list, we need to iterate through the linked list, but we don’t have to do that if we just add the new node to the head of the linked list (like I am doing in this assignment) or if the linked list has a pointer to the tail and we can just jump to the tail and add it there. In these two cases, the time for insertion in the hash table is still going to be constant time even if there are collisions because the way we are inserting it into the hash table is not affected by the number of elements already in there."

    "For the second question, I used three different hash functions that don't use the rolling hashing method. The first one calculates the hash values of the strings in the same way as the first without using the rolling hashing method. This takes a lot more time but it gets the job done. The second one is called the djb2 hash function and it's a clever algorithm that was created by Daniel J. Bernstein in 1991. It accepts a string and then calculates the hash values using the special numbers 33 and 5381. But the trick it uses to reduce the amount of time it takes to run the algorithm is using bitwise shift operators instead of directly multiplying numbers. For example, in the algorithm, it multiplies a number by 33 but instead of directly multiplying the number by 33, it shifts the binary bits 5 units to the left by using the '<<' operator. doing that is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2^5 and then we add the number one more time and means we multiplied the number by 33. This might not seem like much but when we are calculating the hash value over and over again for every substring, then it does really make a difference in terms of the time it takes for the algorithm to run. The line-by-line explanation of the algorithm is given in the code as comments. For the sdbm algorithm, it is the same story. It also gives us a number associated with a string and satisfies most of the conditions that we laid out above that a good hash function should have. It has good distributions among the output space and it gives us a completely different value of output for even a tiny change in input. It also uses the same bitwise operations as the djb2 algorithm and that really helps in decreasing the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to run. The line by line explanation of the function is given in the code, but the gist if it is that, it gives us a good hash value for a given input string that would allow us to decrease the number of collisions since the output is now evenly distributed (which also happens with the djb2 algorithm). How the two compare to each other and with the function that uses rolling hashing is discussed below and supported with experimental plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like mentioned above, the properties of a good hash function are as follows:\n",
    "1. Repeatable: if we have the same input, it should give us the same result every time we run the function\n",
    "2. Fast: it should be fast to compute\n",
    "3. Output unsigned integer: it should not output a negative integer\n",
    "4. Random distribution: it should randomly distribute the keys among the output space. We can have an unlimited number of inputs but our output space is limited. If we are using unsigned integers, we can have from 0 to 2^32-1 and it should be randomly distributed among these numbers\n",
    "5. Small differences in the input should have large differences in the output: for example, the hash value for 'dog' and 'dogs' should give us completely different results that are not very close to each other. This will be helpful in making sure that they don't get accidentally mixed up\n",
    "\n",
    "And also, just like discussed above, the functions I implemented for the second question are ones that satisfy these properties in that they are easy to calculate and they are fast (because they use the bitwise shift operators). They also distribute evenly among the output space and small perturbations in the input give us completely different output which helps in reducing collisions among similar inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash table size for this question is also calculated in the way calculated before. It takes the length of the input string and multiply it by 1.2 to create more space and then take the smallest prime number just above that value. This combination will allow us to have more spaces in the hash table so it doesn't easily get clustered and choosing a prime number as our table size will help us reduce the number of collisions we could have because when we module with a prime number, we get fewer similar remainders as compared to non-prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for data structures, there aren’t additional data structures used in this question that wasn’t used in q1. I only implemented a hash table and a linked list. As described above, the main job of the linked list is to create a chain of the nodes that have the same index because of collision. Therefore, the use of a linked list is a way to address the collision problem by using chaining.\n"

    "To begin with, this algorithm can only detect plagiarism under certain conditions. It only considers ASCII characters and doesn't detect other characters. It also doesn't have any way of telling if the similar substring found in the 2 submissions is directly quoted and cited and thus doesn't need to be considered plagiarized. It doesn't take that into account. It does a lot of preprocessing and cleaning the data that some of the stuff might be lost in the process, so even though it is not perfect, it can still help us detect the possibility of plagiarism and we can then make more thorough searching afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing this to a brute force algorithm, it has a lot of advantages. The brute force method gets every substring from the two submissions and compares them character by character and that is very inefficient. If the len of x is m and the len of y is n, then the brute force method will take O(mn) time, and that is not desirable. The algorithm we used here on the other hand, though, not perfect, it has many advantages over the brute force method. For starters, it doesn't compare each substring in the 2 submissions. It hashes them and then creates a hash table that we can then use to compare substrings in the two submissions. As mentioned above, the method of hashing comes with a problem of collisions and they are unavoidable. But we can deal with them in different ways. The way I dealt with them is by using chaining. One big advantage of this is that when we insert new elements into the hash table, we are guaranteed to have constant time insertion regardless of is there is a collision or not. That is because we insert it in the beginning of the linked list. This way, our on average case, insertion will take constant time, and searching will take constant time as well as compared to the brute force way of dealing with this which gave us O(mn) time.\n"

    "As discussed above, the brute force is the worst in terms of time complexity. But from the different hash functions that we have, we can compare them and see which one outperforms the others. To do this, we can set up an experiment and set up a simulation. I gathered the Shakespeare document from the last assignment and randomly generated x and then randomly generated y from x. I also varied the size of x up to 40,000  so we can see which algorithm performs better when the input gets larger and larger. As expected the one with rolling hashing performs the best. That is because we can think of rolling hashing as a version of dynamic programming. What it does is instead of us calculating the hash value every time from scratch, we use the previously calculated hash value and then adjust that a little bit to get our new hash value. This is dynamic programming because there are overlapping subproblems and we are using the results from one of them to calculate the results of the other. This is also related to optimal substructure as we are getting the optimal result from each computation and then using that in the next instead of computing it from scratch. Therefore, the hash function with rolling hashing performs the best in terms of taking less time, but djb2 is also close even though it doesn’t use any dynamic programming techniques to compute the hash values of subsequent substrings. It can achieve this kind of speed because it is using the bitwise shift operators like discussed above. In the average and best case scenario, all of them will have constant time lookup and insertion, but due to collisions, that is rarely the case and searching might take O(n) time but the constants are significantly lower in the method that uses rolling hashing."

    "1. #coderedability: I used standard Python conventions to write clear and readable code. I provide well-written docstrings and comments throughout the assignment and my code is easy to follow and debug if needed because it is well organized\n",
    "2. #pythonprogramming: I write Python programs that accurately and efficiently implement the required functionality, and do so using Python commands and instructions. When needed, I write my own classes and functions to achieve a certain goal and I explain what I did and why I did it every step of the way\n",
    "3. #datastructures: I clearly explain the data structure that is well suited to my tasks and I discuss it by providing technical information on the data structure, its abstractions, implementations, and functional operations. For example, for the hash table, I discuss why it was relevant in our problem, I discussed its implementation, and different operations like inserting, searching, deleting, etc. I also contrast it with different data structures and give well-justified and accurate explanations supporting my choice of the data structure for the given problem. In this case, I compared the use of a hash table with other data structures and accurately justified why the hash table is the most optimal data structure to use in this case because of its constant time look ups and insertions\n",
    "4. #algorithmicstrategies: I discuss and justify every algorithmic choice I made. When using a randomization technique to produce the plots for testing, I explained why I did that. When I used rolling hashing and compared that to dynamic programming because they are both a way of addressing the same subproblems that are overlapping, I justified that as well. At every step of the way, I explain the choices I make in what kind of algorithm I choose to address a problem and justify it thoroughly\n",
    "5. #computationalcritique: This kind of overlaps with how I used algorithmic strategies and data structures but for every problem, I had different choices for the data structure or algorithm I could choose, and the one I chose is by comparing different approaches, seeing their benefits and downfalls, get the computational complexity for space and time and choose the best data structure and algorithm that suits the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #breakitdown: For this assignment, I applied break it down for every problem tacking a single problem every step of the way\n",
    "2. #dataviz: I produced clear and concise plots that describe my data in a way that is easy to read and get information from \n"
